# GRIP-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Retail

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and analysis of retail-related datasets. It provides extensive resources for conducting exploratory data analysis, uncovering insights, and visualizing trends within the retail domain.

This is a sample code written by me for training the "SampleSuperstore dataset", which is widely available. The implementation takes place within the Google Colab environment.

Current functionalities of this codebase:

1. Generates a comprehensive data summarization and visualization, allowing for insights into the retail dataset.
2. Conducts a thorough examination of diverse parameters within the retail domain to assess their impact on profit and sales.
3. Utilizes data analysis techniques to uncover strategic avenues for increasing profitability.
4. Enables data-driven business decisions by providing insights into the relationship between various parameters and business performance.


Feel free to explore the repository for further details, insights, and visualizations related to the EDA-retail task.
